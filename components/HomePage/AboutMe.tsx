            <p>I am always up for learning, trying out new challenges and growing as a person.</p>
            <p>One such challenge was spending a year with a host family in the United States.</p>
            <p>
              Currently, I am getting started in the workforce while pursuing my education at 42
              Prague.

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Even though I consider myself to be more of an introvert, I won't miss out on team
            bonding activities such as bowling, gaming, or just going out for a beer.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who believe that you can learn a lot about someone from what they drink, my
            favorite beer is Kozel 11°, but Plzeň is alright too I guess.

            <h3>My projects</h3>
            <p>
              I have worked on a bunch of projects, from personal endeavors to client websites and
              group projects as part of the 42 Prague school.{" "}

            <p>
              One of my most significant accomplishments to date was the launch of a fully
              functional Sudoku app, which I coded in Python.
